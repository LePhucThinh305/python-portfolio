# Python Programming Portfolio

This repository contains selected Python projects completed as part of my university coursework for Introduction to Programming (COSC2429).

The projects demonstrate core Python programming skills including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Data validation
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Team-based software development

Each project folder includes:
- A project-specific README
- Assignment specification (PDF)
- Source code
