# group-project – Mars Spaceship Simulation (Group Project)

## Overview
This is a group-based Python project that simulates software systems used aboard a spaceship traveling to Mars.

Multiple subprograms are combined into a single command-line application.

---

## Core Subprograms

### 1. Spaceship Status System
Tracks and displays:

- Current velocity  
- Distance from Earth  
- Distance from Mars  
- Estimated time of arrival  
- Fuel level  
- Fuel burn rate  
- General health of spaceship  
- General health of crew  

Values change logically over time based on calculations.

### 2. Daily Journal System
Allows astronauts to:

- Write journal entries  
- Store date/time, author name, and content  
- Read previous entries  
- Prevent modification of existing records  

Data is stored using text files.

### 3. Additional Creative Subprogram
The group implemented an extra feature to satisfy the creativity requirement (e.g., binary clock or other subsystem).
